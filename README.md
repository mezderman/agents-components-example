# Agent Building Blocks Examples

This repository contains examples of various building blocks and patterns commonly used in building AI agent systems. Each example demonstrates a specific concept or pattern that can be used as a foundation for more complex agent architectures.

## Examples

### 1. Router Agent (`/router-example`)
Demonstrates how to implement an intelligent query router that can direct incoming queries to the appropriate handler based on content analysis. This is useful for:
- Building multi-agent systems where different agents handle different types of queries
- Creating hierarchical agent systems
- Implementing content-based routing logic

### [Future Examples]
- Memory Systems
- Tool Usage
- Planning Systems
- Multi-Agent Communication
- Reflection and Self-Improvement
- Error Handling and Fallbacks

## Getting Started

Each example is contained in its own directory with its own README file that provides:
- Detailed setup instructions
- Usage examples
- Customization guidance
- Explanation of the concept being demonstrated

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- OpenAI API key
- Basic understanding of LLMs and Python

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agent-building-blocks-examples.git
```

2. Navigate to the specific example you want to try and follow its README instructions.

## Contributing
